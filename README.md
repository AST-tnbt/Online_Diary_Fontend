# ONLINE DIARY
## Description
This is the front-end code for a diary web app.
It's my first full-stack project after a period of learning React and Spring Boot.  

Some of the skills I have learned include:
- Creating REST APIs
- Writing unit tests
- Connecting the front-end with the back-end
- Interacting with a database using JPA & Hibernate

I know the website is not yet complete, so any feedback is welcome.
## Use-case model
